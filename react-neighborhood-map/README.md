# FEND Project Seven (Map) #
## Overview ##
This project was created as part of my Grow with Google Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Scholarship.  <br>
This code uses the following components and services beyond the standard React library: 
* Google Maps
* FourSquare (free account)
* React Material-UI for the Drawer
* google-maps-react for the map display 
* Amdoren's free time zone API 
* Airvisual free API
### Note ###
If if there is an error on the JavaScript console about the FourSquare API, please wait a few minutes and refresh the page to resolve the error.
## Setup ##

```bash
